Conditional rendering:
When the browser navigates to the /foo route, the first /foo route handler is
accessed. The handler picks a random number 0, or 1. If 1 is selected the response "sometimes this"
in plain text is sent. Otherwise the next route handler is picked, in this case is
another /foo route handler that sends the response "and sometimes that" is sent.

Regex Route:
if any route that begins with /user is navigated to in the browser, the server will respond with
the path that was specified.

Route parameters:
The parameter (username) is captured at a specific place in the URL request.
that value is passed through the req.params object and the key is defined as the parameter.
in this case: req.params == { username : 'bc' }
